"""Synthetic world model — demo insurance, offline development, and the only
place we have a perfect emission inventory to score attribution against.

DESIGN RULE: the generator must never be the scorer in disguise. An earlier
version emitted its hidden sources straight into the OSM layer with exact
coordinates and exact category labels, and used the same
`exp(-d/2) * wind_alignment` kernel that the attribution scorer uses — so
"100% attribution accuracy" was an arithmetic identity, not a measurement.
Four deliberate adversarial choices keep the evaluation honest:

  1. DIFFERENT PHYSICS. Emissions disperse as a Gaussian plume (crosswind
     spread widening with downwind distance, 1/x dilution). The attribution
     scorer assumes isotropic `exp(-d/2) * cos(wind)`. Same story, different
     functional family — so recovering the source is real inference.

  2. COLUMN != SURFACE. The satellite sees a *column load* with no boundary-layer
     trapping; a station measures *surface* concentration, which is the same
     emission multiplied by the trapping factor. Bridging the two is exactly the
     job we claim the fusion model does, so it now has to actually do it (and
     BLH has to earn its place as a feature).

  3. THE SATELLITE IS BLURRY. TROPOMI ground pixels are ~5.5 km; an H3 res-8
     cell is ~460 m. Columns are Gaussian-blurred to match, so nothing can read
     a per-cell truth signal out of them.

  4. THE MAP LIES. Registered sources land in OSM with a position error; some
     sources are UNREGISTERED (illegal burning, unpermitted sites) and appear
     nowhere in OSM — attribution must recover them from signature and fire
     evidence alone; and DECOY sites (dormant estates, finished construction)
     sit in OSM emitting nothing, so proximity to a mapped polygon is not proof.

The eval (`scripts/eval_attribution.py`) reports registered and unregistered
accuracy separately, because those are two different claims.

    # INSTRUMENT NOISE, CALIBRATED TO THE REAL INSTRUMENT.
    #
    # This is where the old 4/4 came from, and it was our own fault. We made the
    # SOURCES adversarial and left the SENSORS perfect: SO2 got a clean industrial
    # signature (noise sigma 4.5 on a signal of ~60) and AAI a clean burning one. So
    # the detector learned to trust two channels that, in reality, are noise — and
    # scored 4/4 on a world that flattered its own instruments.
    #
    # Measured on real S5P over Bengaluru AND Delhi (scripts/compare_cities.py):
    #   NO2  median  43 umol/m2, MAD  12   -> SNR 2.6-2.8   usable
    #   SO2  median   3 umol/m2, MAD  91   -> SNR 0.66-0.87 NOISE (49% NEGATIVE)
    #   AAI  median -0.39,       MAD 0.48  -> SNR 0.76-1.03 NOISE
    #
    # So SO2 and AAI now carry the noise they really carry. They stay in the schema
    # (they are real products, and honest evidence for a human to look at) but any
    # model that leans on them will now be punished here, exactly as it is punished
    # in reality. Model an instrument's NOISE before you model its signal.

    # ones found Bhalswa. The count was never the point. The burst is.

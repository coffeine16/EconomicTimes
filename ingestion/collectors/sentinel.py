"""Sentinel-5P collector — the real satellite, via Google Earth Engine.

This is the layer detection actually runs on. Everything else in the platform can
degrade gracefully to synthetic; this one cannot, because a synthetic satellite
joined to real stations is not a degraded product, it is a *wrong* one (see
`pollers.run`, which now refuses that combination outright).

WHAT WE PULL — the four products the detector already expects:

    L3_NO2     tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density   traffic, combustion, industry
    L3_SO2     SO2_column_number_density                INDUSTRY (point-source tracer)
    L3_CO      CO_column_number_density                 combustion
    L3_AER_AI  absorbing_aerosol_index                  SMOKE / burning

TWO PHYSICAL FACTS THAT SHAPE THIS FILE

1. S5P's ground pixel is ~5.5 x 3.5 km. An H3 res-8 cell is ~460 m. The GEE L3
   product is *gridded* to ~1113 m, but gridding does not manufacture information
   that the instrument never resolved. Neighbouring cells are therefore strongly
   correlated by construction — which is exactly why detection scores a cell
   against an annulus 4-8 km away (outside the footprint) and not against its
   immediate neighbours, and why the synthetic world blurs to match. Do not
   "improve" this by sampling at a finer scale; the detail is not there.

2. One overpass per day, ~13:30 local, and clouds punch holes in it. So a single
   day is a weak observation, which is why every window here is a MEDIAN over
   many days and why gaps are left as NaN for the panel to forward-fill rather
   than being invented here.

UNITS: columns come back in mol/m^2 (~1e-5). We rescale to umol/m^2 so the numbers
are human-readable. This is safe because every consumer is scale-invariant —
detection uses robust z-scores and neighbourhood contrast, attribution uses city
percentiles, and LightGBM is invariant to monotone per-feature transforms. AAI is
already dimensionless and is left alone.

"""Pull the two n8n-written Supabase tables down to the files the pipeline reads.

The pipeline is batch and file-based by design; Supabase is where the CHANNELS
write. This is the bridge, run before (or by) the pipeline:

    citizen_reports    -> data/outputs/citizen_reports.json
                          (attribution's citizen_corroboration evidence)
    inspection_status  -> data/outputs/inspection_status.json

                          was proven with a hand-written copy before n8n existed)

Needs SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in .env. Absent -> skips gracefully:
the pipeline must never fail because the channel layer isn't configured
(principle 2), it just runs without citizen/inspector evidence — which is
exactly today's behaviour.

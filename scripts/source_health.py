"""Measure how gappy each data source actually is, and what survives when it lags.

THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS: sources update asynchronously — CPCB stations drop out,
Sentinel-5P sees through cloud only ~2 days in 3, FIRMS fires are event-driven and
sparse. If the platform quietly depended on any one of them being fresh, it would
be brittle in exactly the way a city cannot afford.

It does not, and that is a design decision we can show receipts for:

  * DETECTION NEVER READS A STATION. It runs on satellite NO2 contrast + FIRMS
    fire persistence, both of which cover every cell equally. Measured, not
    asserted: scripts/eval_station_sensitivity.py re-runs detection with station
    siting dialled from realistic to none and recall does not move.
  * EVERY AGGREGATE IS A MEDIAN OVER A WINDOW (24h/7d/30d), never a mean over the
    latest reading. A source missing a third of its days still yields a valid
    30-day median; one spike hour cannot manufacture a source.
  * FIRE PERSISTENCE IS A FRACTION OF THE WINDOW, not a count, so it is defined
    for a source that reports 18 times in 60 days.
  * CRITICAL SOURCES REFUSE TO FAKE. pollers.NO_FALLBACK aborts a live run rather
    than substitute synthetic satellite/fire/OSM — each of those invents a place
    we would then accuse.

**An air quality platform that names *who* is polluting, *where*, with *what
evidence*, and *what to do about it today* — not another map of how bad the air
is.**

India does not have a monitoring problem; it has an action problem. Over 900
CAAQMS stations exist, yet a 2024 CAG audit found only **31%** of monitored
cities had any actionable response protocol. Meanwhile the monitors themselves
lie about coverage: CPCB siting norms deliberately place them *away from
sources*, so the official map is a **measurement log, not a pollution census**.

This platform detects sources from instruments that cover **every cell equally**,
names them with an inspectable evidence chain, and reports honestly on what it
**cannot** see.

</p>

**Why your air is like this.** Here it says *no source was attributed in your
ward* — because none was. Our instruments found nothing standing out, and the
panel says so rather than inventing a cause. Where a source *is* found, its
evidence chain appears in the same place.

**How much to trust this number.** *"The nearest government monitor is 6.7 km
away. There is no sensor in your ward, so this number is an estimate built from
satellite data, weather and local land use — not a measurement. Most of this city
has no monitor; showing you a number without saying so would be the dishonest
part."* Where a monitor **is** close, the same panel says so instead. The claim
tracks the evidence.

**When to go outside, and how to talk back.** Cleanest around 10am at AQI 271,
worst around 7pm at 383 — the swing across one day is larger than the change from
one day to the next, which is exactly what a 24-hour forecast hides. And the
report form turns a resident into the one instrument that sees construction dust,
which no satellite can.

## Run it in under a minute

No API keys. No cloud account. The whole pipeline runs offline against a
synthetic world with known ground truth, so every number below is reproducible on
your machine right now.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."                                    # PowerShell (bash: export PYTHONPATH=.)

python scripts/run_pipeline.py --synthetic --full        # ingest → panel → fusion → detect → attribute
python scripts/eval_detection.py                         # THE headline stat
```

Then serve it:

The `--full` run drives the whole **9-agent pipeline** and writes every JSON
contract (`hotspots`, `attributions`, `forecast`, `actions`, `dispatch`, `memos`,
`advisories`, `ledger`) to `data/outputs/`. Then serve it:

```bash
uvicorn app.backend.main:app --reload --port 8000        # 23 endpoints: /hotspots, /attribution/{cell}, /actions, /dispatch, /ledger, /advisories …
```

## The headline result

**On real data.** Delhi, November 2025 — real Sentinel-5P, real NASA FIRMS, real
CPCB stations, real OpenStreetMap:

> ### Bhalswa landfill → `waste_burning`, confidence 0.76
> *evidence: satellite fire detections in 30 hours (18% of the window);
> shallow boundary layer (120 m) trapping emissions*

A real polluter, in a real city, from public satellite data, with an evidence chain
**anyone can check** — google *"Bhalswa landfill fire November 2025"*.

(Okhla landfill → `traffic`; it genuinely sits on Mathura Road — defensible but
incomplete. Ghazipur → not detected: no fires in the window. We report all three.)

**On the synthetic world**, where ground truth exists and accuracy can actually be
*scored*, recall is reported by **what the instruments can physically see**:

| tier | recall |
|---|---|
| **direct — thermal fire** (waste burning) | **2/2 found and correctly named** — and **both appear on no map at all** |
| **NO₂, confounded** (industrial, traffic) | **0/4** — NO₂ is a real tracer, but the road network lifts it citywide, so a point source must out-shout its own neighbourhood |
| **no tracer at all** (construction) | **0/3** — coarse PM. Nothing sees it. |

Enforceable-**zone** precision **2/2**. Attribution **100%** (16/16, all
unregistered). ⚠️ Small n — never sell these as rates.

And the number the whole thing exists for:

> **An unbiased 12-monitor network catches a median of 1 source in 9.**
> It misses eight. That is not siting bias — that is *geometry*. A dozen sensors
> cannot cover a city, however honestly you place them.

### We used to claim 4/4. It was not real.

The two *industrial* sources were being found via **SO₂ contrast**. Then we pulled
the real satellite: **real S5P SO₂ over a city is noise** — 49% of readings are
*negative*, a physical impossibility, with a MAD 30× the median (SNR 0.7). TROPOMI's
SO₂ band is built for volcanoes; an urban factory is far below its floor. The
aerosol index is no better (SNR 1.0).

On real Delhi, scoring across all three channels flagged **470 of 1,703 cells — 28%
of the city — and 87% of those were driven by SO₂ or AAI noise.** We were
manufacturing enforcement targets out of retrieval error, and a genuinely burning
landfill ranked *below* them.

So we deleted both channels, and the industrial sources went with them. **4/4 → 2/4.**
Our simulation had given the instruments a signal they do not have — the same class
of error as [the 100% trap](#the-100-trap), one level deeper.

### The evaluation was flattering our own baseline

Forecasts are scored against **persistence** — *"it will stay as it is."* We kept
losing to it at 24 h and could not work out why the model was so weak.

It was not. The **evaluation** was.

PM2.5 runs on a daily cycle, so persistence is accidentally *in phase* at 24-hour
multiples — it compares a value to the same hour of the previous day. Between
those points it compares night to day and collapses. On real Delhi:

| lead | 3 h | 12 h | **24 h** | 36 h | **48 h** | 60 h | **72 h** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| our model | 59.6 | 69.4 | 74.0 | 77.9 | 80.8 | 81.2 | 81.3 |
| persistence | 69.4 | 107.6 | **76.2** | 117.3 | **92.7** | 116.2 | **87.5** |
| skill | +14% | +36% | **+3%** | +34% | **+13%** | +30% | **+7%** |

Every standard benchmark — including the one in our own brief — samples 24, 48 and
72 h. **Exactly the three points where the baseline is strongest.** Re-scored every
three hours, the model beats persistence at all 24 lead times in Delhi.

**And in Chennai we lose.** It is coastal, the sea breeze flattens the diurnal
cycle, persistence stays strong, and we do not beat it until 51 h. We ship that
curve beside Delhi's — a method that only publishes the city where it wins is not
a method.

We also tested adding a meteorology forecast, as an **oracle**: feeding the model
the met that actually occurred, the most favourable case that exists. It did not
help in any city, so we did not build the plumbing. A negative result we went
looking for.

---

## How it works — the whole system at a glance

Three tiers: a **batch data platform** turns raw feeds into a feature table; a
**9-agent pipeline** turns that table into named sources, priorities, memos and
advisories; a **read-only serving layer** exposes precomputed JSON that the
frontend and channels consume. Heavy compute never touches a request handler.

```

**LLMs explain. Deterministic code decides.** Category scores, priority scores,
and every ranking are plain reproducible arithmetic. An LLM may only write prose
explaining a score that was already computed — and if it disagrees with the
arithmetic, **the arithmetic wins and the LLM output is discarded.** Every
LLM path has a rule-based fallback with an identical output schema, so a missing
API key degrades the *prose*, never the *answer*. **This discipline holds even at
the edge** — the citizen-intake bot lets an LLM *extract* fields from a free-text
report, but deterministic code canonicalises the ward against the official list
and clamps the category before anything is stored (see the [citizen loop](#the-citizen-loop--from-a-phone-to-the-evidence-chain)).

---

## The agent pipeline — signal to action

One `LangGraph` state machine runs nine agents over a shared typed state. Each
node is wrapped so one failure degrades the output instead of killing the run; the
same graph backs both the batch pipeline and the API's `POST /run/agent`, so chain
order can never drift between them.

Green nodes are pure arithmetic; amber nodes call an LLM **for prose only**, each
with a rule-based fallback. Every agent writes a versioned JSON contract to
`data/outputs/` that the API serves read-only.

---

## Detection: why not the fusion field?

This is the most important thing in the repo, and it cost us a rewrite to learn.

The original design ran hotspot detection on the fusion field. **It cannot work,
and we measured why:**

```
Training stations see a mean source contribution of  0.25 µg/m³   (p99 = 6.7)
The rest of the city reaches                       210    µg/m³
Only 6 of 4,032 station-hours have a fire nearby — against 4,414 citywide
```

The model trains only on cells containing a station, and CPCB siting deliberately
places stations *away from sources* — the very fact the fusion layer's rationale
rests on. So it **never observes a source**, cannot learn a source response, and
(being a tree ensemble) **cannot extrapolate to one**: LightGBM predicts
piecewise-constant, so a cell whose NO₂ column is far above anything a station
ever saw gets the same prediction as the worst station. Its field is
background-dominated by construction.

**The fusion field is an exposure map, not a detector.** It answers *"what is a
person in this cell breathing"*. On the synthetic world it does that well — LOSO
R² 0.90, ~36% better than the station-mean map. **On real Delhi it does not**: it
is worse than a naive city mean, and we withdraw the claim rather than quote the
synthetic number. Detection is the contribution; see the status table.

Detection instead runs on the two instruments with **uniform coverage — every
cell, no siting bias:**

    A -->|"only high NO₂ over dense roads"| DIF["DIFFUSE urban background<br/>real pollution, nobody to serve a notice on<br/>→ policy target, stays on the map"]
```

Three rules hold this together:

- **Never the mean.** Every aggregate is a **median**, every spread a **MAD**. In
  this domain the outliers *are* the phenomenon: a mean lets one spike hour
  manufacture a chronic source out of a single bonfire.
- **One window is not a signal.** A real-time spike is noise. A source is what is
  still there when you zoom out.
- **Contrast, not rank.** Compare a cell to *its own neighbourhood*, not to the
  city. "This district is dense" is true, unactionable, and not a violator.

## The citizen loop — from a phone to the evidence chain

Citizens are a third observation tier — *"900 stations + 2 satellites + a million
human sensors"* — and, uniquely, the only instrument that can see the construction
dust the satellite is blind to. The intake is a live Telegram bot (and a web form
against the same endpoint), deployed on n8n behind automatic HTTPS.

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
  <sub>A citizen never types a ward ID. Search by name, share location, or tap the
  hexagon they are standing in — and the citywide number is there before they
  pick, so the page is useful on the first screen.</sub>

    class FIN,SYNC,ATT det
```

**Proven end-to-end**, not just wired. A live report against a detected
`waste_burning` zone lifts its confidence **0.77 → 0.84** and adds
*"Citizen reports of waste burning"* to its evidence factors — because it counts as
**one more independent agreeing instrument** (fire + citizen = 2), computed by
deterministic math. The lift is **capped**: a brigade of reports can never
manufacture a source or out-shout the satellite. Reports outside the evidence
window, or that match no real ward, correctly do **not** corroborate.

> **Honest footnote.** That lift was demonstrated live, and it is **not present in
> the shipped Delhi data** — 0 of 53 attributions carry citizen corroboration. The
> reports are from today; the Delhi case study is a November 2025 window. Citizens
> cannot report into a historical window, and we will not widen the evidence window
> to manufacture a match. It is a live capability shown on a historical case.

The same bot carries the **inspector loop** — an inspector replies `done <id>`, the
status is written back, and the ledger stamps the response time. Two audiences, one
channel; the channel moves bytes and nothing more.

## What's real vs prototype

Because a README that oversells is the same bug as a metric that oversells.

| | Status |
|---|---|
| Ingestion — Sentinel-5P, OpenAQ, Open-Meteo, FIRMS, OSM | ✅ **all real and live.** Run end-to-end on Delhi, Nov 2025 |
| H3 spatial fabric + real ward boundaries | ✅ real (official Datameet GeoJSON for Bengaluru/Delhi/Chennai; Voronoi fallback) |
| Detection (NO₂ contrast + fire persistence) | ✅ real — validated on a real landfill fire |
| Attribution + evidence chain + confidence | ✅ real, truth-scored, calibrated |
| Forecast — 3-hourly to +72 h vs persistence baseline | ✅ real. One pooled LightGBM with the lead time as a feature, scored at **24 lead times** on a held-out tail. See [the sawtooth](#the-evaluation-was-flattering-our-own-baseline) — and the city where we lose |
| Prioritisation (EPS) + dispatch routing | ✅ real — deterministic score, greedy set-cover, per-team routes |
| Enforcement memo + rule-matched legal basis | ✅ real — deterministic legal citation, LLM drafts prose only |
| Ward advisory agent — English + city language | ✅ real — **every ward, not a sample**: Delhi 267 wards in en/hi, Chennai 177 in en/ta, Bengaluru 227 in en/kn, with per-language verification labels (native-speaker vs cross-checked — never claims a review it didn't get) |
| Intervention ledger — response time + counterfactual | ✅ real. Response-time is honest (CAG's *weeks* vs one automated batch); effectiveness freezes the +48 h counterfactual, `our_impact: null` until a real intervention exists |
| Channels — n8n citizen intake + inspector loop | ✅ **live.** Telegram bot + web webhook → Supabase, proven end-to-end into the evidence chain |
| Read-only serving API (23 endpoints) | ✅ real |
| **Fusion exposure field** | ❌ **claim withdrawn.** On real Delhi it is **14% worse than a naive city-mean** (RMSE 75.4 vs 66.0). We tried predicting the *deviation* from the city median — a construction that cannot lose to the baseline — and it still lost, which means the spatial model has **no transferable skill** across held-out stations. We do not claim it. |
| **Frontend — Next.js + deck.gl console** | ✅ **deployed.** Admin console and citizen view live on Vercel, reading the live API with a static-bundle fallback so the map still renders if the backend is down |
| GEE Sentinel-5P collector | ✅ **built and wired** — real `COPERNICUS/S5P` extraction; it produced the real Delhi result. Live satellite needs GEE auth on the run machine (`gcloud auth application-default login`); until then synthetic mode runs fully offline |
| **Intervention effectiveness** | ❌ **not claimed.** The ledger freezes the +48 h counterfactual at dispatch and waits for a real actioned outcome. Zero of four actions are actioned, so `our_impact` is `null`. Response *time* is real; response *effect* is not yet measurable |

</p>
| Voice advisory **audio** (TTS) | ✅ real — Google TTS, 71 clips per city, played in the citizen view and pushed as Telegram voice notes |

A **spoken** report — *"Delhi Cant, Charj 1 mein kachra jal raha hai"* — is
transcribed, the ward is canonicalised against the official list (`Charj 1` →

ward's advisory comes back **as audio**. No typing, no app, no literacy

## The 100% trap

This project once reported **100% attribution accuracy**. It was an artefact, and
the story is worth the two minutes.

The synthetic world was emitting its hidden sources straight into the OSM layer
with **exact coordinates and exact category labels**, and dispersing them with the
*same* `exp(-d/2)·wind_alignment` kernel the attribution scorer uses. The scorer
was being handed the answer key and congratulated for reading it.

`ingestion/synthetic.py` is now deliberately **adversarial**:

- **different physics** — a Gaussian plume the scorer does not assume
- **sources that appear on no map at all** (illegal burning files no paperwork)
- **decoy sites** that are on the map and emit nothing
- **a satellite blurred to its true ~5.5 km footprint**
- **column-vs-surface decoupling** — the satellite sees no boundary-layer trapping;
  a station does. Bridging that gap is the fusion model's actual job

The score collapsed. *That collapse was the finding.* Every number in this README
survived the rebuild.

We caught the same class of error a second time: the stat *"0 of 9 sources sit
within 2 km of a monitor"* was **guaranteed by the world model's own placement
rule** (~99% true by construction) and was being reported as a discovery. It has
been replaced by the unbiased-network number above, which owes nothing to any
assumption we made.

> **If a number ever comes back at 100%, assume leakage before you assume success.**

## Repo layout

```
app/            backend/main.py — read-only FastAPI (23 endpoints, ?city= scoped)
                frontend/       — Next.js + deck.gl console + citizen view
ingestion/      collectors (6 sources, live + synthetic fallback)
                preprocessing/panel.py — the cell × hour feature table
                synthetic.py — the adversarial hidden-source world
intelligence/   orchestrator.py     — the 9-agent LangGraph state machine
                models/fusion.py    — LightGBM exposure field
                models/signals.py   — robust multi-window statistics
                agents/             — detect, attribution, forecast, prioritise,
                                      memo, advisory, voice, ledger, audit
                                      + llm_gateway
shared/         config, H3 grid utilities, real ward layer (3 cities)
scripts/        run_pipeline.py, sync_supabase.py + truth-scored evaluations
db/             schema.sql — Supabase contracts the channel layer writes to
deploy/         n8n on GCP: Terraform + Caddy + DuckDNS runbook
docs/           architecture.md — the 9-layer design and why it's shaped this way
```

## Evaluations

Every claim in this README is a script you can run.

```bash
python scripts/eval_detection.py            # sources found vs missed; enforceable-zone precision
python scripts/eval_attribution.py          # accuracy, split registered vs unregistered; confidence calibration
python scripts/eval_station_sensitivity.py  # is the headline an artefact of where we put the monitors? (no)
python scripts/eval_hotspot_recovery.py     # fusion as an EXPOSURE map — and why it is not a detector
```

## Roadmap

**Shipped.** Sentinel-5P via Google Earth Engine · 9-agent LangGraph pipeline ·
real Datameet ward boundaries for three cities · n8n citizen intake and inspector
loop, proven end-to-end into the evidence chain · multi-language advisory text and
voice · Next.js console and citizen view on Vercel · read-only API and live agent
runs on Cloud Run, serving all three cities from one instance.

**Known gaps, stated rather than hidden:**

- [ ] **Construction dust is invisible to us** — recall 0/3. It is coarse PM with
      no satellite tracer and it does not burn. Closing it needs Sentinel-2 optical
      change detection, the OSM permit layer, and citizen reports at volume.
- [ ] **Traffic corridors are confounded** — recall 0/4. The road network lifts NO₂
      across the whole core, so a corridor cannot out-shout its own neighbourhood.
- [ ] **Citizen corroboration has never fired on the shipped data.** The path works
      and is proven — a Bhalswa report resolves to the right ward and lifts
      confidence — but the reports are from today and the Delhi case study is
      November 2025. Citizens cannot report into a historical window.
- [ ] **Intervention effectiveness is unmeasured.** The counterfactual is frozen at
      dispatch; it needs a real actioned inspection to become an impact number.
- [ ] **No rate limiting on the public report webhook.** It is an unauthenticated
      intake form by design; abuse handling is not built.
- [ ] Kannada advisory text is `cross_checked`, not native-verified.

  building an evaluation honest enough to tell us the models were wrong.</sub>

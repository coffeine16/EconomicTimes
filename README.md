**An air quality platform that names *who* is polluting, *where*, with *what
evidence*, and *what to do about it today* — not another map of how bad the air
is.**

India does not have a monitoring problem; it has an action problem. Over 900
CAAQMS stations exist, yet a 2024 CAG audit found only **31%** of monitored
cities had any actionable response protocol. Meanwhile the monitors themselves
lie about coverage: CPCB siting norms deliberately place them *away from
sources*, so the official map is a **measurement log, not a pollution census**.

This platform detects sources from instruments that cover **every cell equally**,
names them with an inspectable evidence chain, and reports honestly on what it
**cannot** see.

## Run it in under a minute

No API keys. No cloud account. The whole pipeline runs offline against a
synthetic world with known ground truth, so every number below is reproducible on
your machine right now.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."                                    # PowerShell (bash: export PYTHONPATH=.)

python scripts/run_pipeline.py --synthetic --full        # ingest → panel → fusion → detect → attribute
python scripts/eval_detection.py                         # THE headline stat
```

Then serve it:

```bash
uvicorn app.backend.main:app --reload --port 8000        # GET /hotspots, /attribution/{cell}, /wards, /fusion, /loso
```

> **There is no deployed demo and no frontend yet.** The API is real and
> read-only; the React/Leaflet console is the next build. See
> [what's real vs prototype](#whats-real-vs-prototype) — we'd rather tell you
> than let you find out.

## The headline result

**On real data.** Delhi, November 2025 — real Sentinel-5P, real NASA FIRMS, real
CPCB stations, real OpenStreetMap:

> ### 🔥 Bhalswa landfill → `waste_burning`, confidence 0.67
> *evidence: satellite fire detections in 30 hours (18% of the window);
> shallow boundary layer (120 m) trapping emissions*

A real polluter, in a real city, from public satellite data, with an evidence chain
**anyone can check** — google *"Bhalswa landfill fire November 2025"*.

(Okhla landfill → `traffic`; it genuinely sits on Mathura Road — defensible but
incomplete. Ghazipur → not detected: no fires in the window. We report all three.)

**On the synthetic world**, where ground truth exists and accuracy can actually be
*scored*, recall is reported by **what the instruments can physically see**:

| tier | recall |
|---|---|
| **direct — thermal fire** (waste burning) | **2/2 found and correctly named** — and **both appear on no map at all** |
| **NO₂, confounded** (industrial, traffic) | **0/4** — NO₂ is a real tracer, but the road network lifts it citywide, so a point source must out-shout its own neighbourhood |
| **no tracer at all** (construction) | **0/3** — coarse PM. Nothing sees it. |

Enforceable-**zone** precision **2/2**. Attribution **100%** (16/16, all
unregistered). ⚠️ Small n — never sell these as rates.

And the number the whole thing exists for:

> **An unbiased 12-monitor network catches a median of 1 source in 9.**
> It misses eight. That is not siting bias — that is *geometry*. A dozen sensors
> cannot cover a city, however honestly you place them.

### We used to claim 4/4. It was not real.

The two *industrial* sources were being found via **SO₂ contrast**. Then we pulled
the real satellite: **real S5P SO₂ over a city is noise** — 49% of readings are
*negative*, a physical impossibility, with a MAD 30× the median (SNR 0.7). TROPOMI's
SO₂ band is built for volcanoes; an urban factory is far below its floor. The
aerosol index is no better (SNR 1.0).

On real Delhi, scoring across all three channels flagged **470 of 1,703 cells — 28%
of the city — and 87% of those were driven by SO₂ or AAI noise.** We were
manufacturing enforcement targets out of retrieval error, and a genuinely burning
landfill ranked *below* them.

So we deleted both channels, and the industrial sources went with them. **4/4 → 2/4.**
Our simulation had given the instruments a signal they do not have — the same class
of error as [the 100% trap](#the-100-trap), one level deeper.

```

**LLMs explain. Deterministic code decides.** Category scores, priority scores,
and every ranking are plain reproducible arithmetic. An LLM may only write prose
explaining a score that was already computed — and if it disagrees with the
arithmetic, **the arithmetic wins and the LLM output is discarded.** Every
LLM path has a rule-based fallback with an identical output schema, so a missing
API key degrades the *prose*, never the *answer*.

## Detection: why not the fusion field?

This is the most important thing in the repo, and it cost us a rewrite to learn.

The original design ran hotspot detection on the fusion field. **It cannot work,
and we measured why:**

```
Training stations see a mean source contribution of  0.25 µg/m³   (p99 = 6.7)
The rest of the city reaches                       210    µg/m³
Only 6 of 4,032 station-hours have a fire nearby — against 4,414 citywide
```

The model trains only on cells containing a station, and CPCB siting deliberately
places stations *away from sources* — the very fact the fusion layer's rationale
rests on. So it **never observes a source**, cannot learn a source response, and
(being a tree ensemble) **cannot extrapolate to one**: LightGBM predicts
piecewise-constant, so a cell whose NO₂ column is far above anything a station
ever saw gets the same prediction as the worst station. Its field is
background-dominated by construction.

**The fusion field is an exposure map, not a detector.** It answers *"what is a
person in this cell breathing"* — which it does well (LOSO R² 0.90, ~36% better
than the station-mean map) and which is a genuinely useful product.

Detection instead runs on the two instruments with **uniform coverage — every
cell, no siting bias:**

```mermaid

    SAT["Satellite NO₂ column<br/>per-cell MEDIAN per window<br/>(SO₂/AAI dropped — measured noise)"] --> CON["Neighbourhood contrast<br/>vs the 4–8 km annulus, in MAD units"]

    CON --> W{"Multi-window agreement<br/>24h / 7d / 30d"}
    W -->|"elevated over 30 d"| CHR["chronic<br/>a standing violator → build the case file"]
    W -->|"7 d, not 30 d"| EME["emerging<br/>newly commissioned → act now"]
    W -->|"24 h only"| ACU["acute<br/>a fire → send a truck, not a notice"]

    A -->|"only high NO₂ over dense roads"| DIF["DIFFUSE urban background<br/>real pollution, nobody to serve a notice on<br/>→ policy target, stays on the map"]
```

Three rules hold this together:

- **Never the mean.** Every aggregate is a **median**, every spread a **MAD**. In
  this domain the outliers *are* the phenomenon: a mean lets one spike hour
  manufacture a chronic source out of a single bonfire.
- **One window is not a signal.** A real-time spike is noise. A source is what is
  still there when you zoom out.
- **Contrast, not rank.** Compare a cell to *its own neighbourhood*, not to the
  city. "This district is dense" is true, unactionable, and not a violator.

## What's real vs prototype

Because a README that oversells is the same bug as a metric that oversells.

| | Status |
|---|---|
| Ingestion — Sentinel-5P, OpenAQ, Open-Meteo, FIRMS, OSM | ✅ **all real and live.** Run end-to-end on Delhi, Nov 2025 |
| H3 spatial fabric + ward layer | ✅ real (official GeoJSON if present, deterministic Voronoi fallback) |
| Detection (NO₂ contrast + fire persistence) | ✅ real — validated on a real landfill fire |
| Attribution + evidence chain + confidence | ✅ real, truth-scored, calibrated |
| **Fusion exposure field** | ❌ **claim withdrawn.** On real Delhi it is **14% worse than a naive city-mean** (RMSE 75.4 vs 66.0). We tried predicting the *deviation* from the city median — a construction that cannot lose to the baseline — and it still lost, which means the spatial model has **no transferable skill** across held-out stations. We do not claim it. |
| Read-only serving API | ✅ real |
| Forecast, EPS/dispatch, memo, advisory, frontend, n8n | ⬜ **not built** |

> ### ⚠️ Live mode refuses to fake anything
> If the satellite, fire, or OSM collector fails, the pipeline **raises rather than
> substituting synthetic data**. Each of those layers *invents a place we would then
> accuse* — a fabricated output, not a degraded one. (Stations may degrade: they
> feed the exposure map, not the detector.)
>
> ### ⚠️ Don't run it in monsoon
> July is the worst possible month for both instruments: cloud masks 71% of the NO₂
> retrieval, and **nothing burns when it is wet** — real FIRMS returns **2 fires over
> Bengaluru in 60 days** (our synthetic world had 281). Both channels go blind.
> Delhi's burning season is **October–November**, which is where the real result
> above comes from.

## The 100% trap

This project once reported **100% attribution accuracy**. It was an artefact, and
the story is worth the two minutes.

The synthetic world was emitting its hidden sources straight into the OSM layer
with **exact coordinates and exact category labels**, and dispersing them with the
*same* `exp(-d/2)·wind_alignment` kernel the attribution scorer uses. The scorer
was being handed the answer key and congratulated for reading it.

`ingestion/synthetic.py` is now deliberately **adversarial**:

- **different physics** — a Gaussian plume the scorer does not assume
- **sources that appear on no map at all** (illegal burning files no paperwork)
- **decoy sites** that are on the map and emit nothing
- **a satellite blurred to its true ~5.5 km footprint**
- **column-vs-surface decoupling** — the satellite sees no boundary-layer trapping;
  a station does. Bridging that gap is the fusion model's actual job

The score collapsed. *That collapse was the finding.* Every number in this README
survived the rebuild.

We caught the same class of error a second time: the stat *"0 of 9 sources sit
within 2 km of a monitor"* was **guaranteed by the world model's own placement
rule** (~99% true by construction) and was being reported as a discovery. It has
been replaced by the unbiased-network number above, which owes nothing to any
assumption we made.

> **If a number ever comes back at 100%, assume leakage before you assume success.**

## Evaluations

Every claim in this README is a script you can run.

```bash
python scripts/eval_detection.py            # sources found vs missed; enforceable-zone precision
python scripts/eval_attribution.py          # accuracy, split registered vs unregistered; confidence calibration
python scripts/eval_station_sensitivity.py  # is the headline an artefact of where we put the monitors? (no)
python scripts/eval_hotspot_recovery.py     # fusion as an EXPOSURE map — and why it is not a detector
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Sentinel-5P collector via Google Earth Engine** — the critical path; live mode is invalid without it
- [ ] Sentinel-2 optical change detection → close the construction blind spot (S5P never will)
- [ ] Forecast agent (wind-weighted STGCN + persistence baseline)
- [ ] Enforcement Priority Score + dispatch routing
- [ ] Enforcement memo agent with a rule-matched legal basis
- [ ] React + Leaflet admin console and citizen view
- [ ] n8n channels: citizen intake, voice advisories, inspector loop
- [ ] Real ward boundaries (BBMP GeoJSON) — the Voronoi fallback is a placeholder, not a legal boundary

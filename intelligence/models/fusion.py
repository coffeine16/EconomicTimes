"""The fusion field — and the honest verdict on it.

⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING ANY NUMBER FROM THIS FILE.

The "coverage-debiased exposure map" is NOT VALIDATED ON REAL DATA. On Delhi
(24 real CPCB stations, Nov 2025), leave-one-station-out says:

    fusion            RMSE 75.4   R2 0.52
    naive city-mean   RMSE 66.0            <- BETTER, by 14%

We tried the obvious fix: predict the DEVIATION from the city median rather than
the absolute level, so the model only has to learn what stations cannot tell you.
That construction cannot lose to the baseline — predicting a zero residual IS the
baseline — and yet it still lost. Which means the residual model is predicting
NON-ZERO spatial corrections that are WRONG: it is fitting the training stations'
local siting quirks (roadside vs background), not learnable spatial structure that
transfers to a station it has never seen.

THE HONEST READING: with ~24 stations, we cannot demonstrate that our spatial model
improves on a city-mean at a held-out station. The exposure claim in Layer 3 does
not survive contact with real data, and we do not make it. Detection is the
contribution; this is an interpolation we cannot prove is better than the trivial
one. (On the synthetic world it does win — LOSO R2 0.84 vs naive 9.97 RMSE — but a
synthetic world we wrote is not evidence about Delhi.)

The field is still produced and still used for EXPOSURE context (pm25_med in a
hotspot card, the severity term). It is not sold as validated.

Train on cells that HAVE a station (features -> measured PM2.5), predict every
cell citywide. Headline number: leave-one-station-out (LOSO) — hide each station
entirely, predict its cell from the others, report the error.

# PREDICT THE DEVIATION, NOT THE LEVEL.
#
# The old model predicted absolute PM2.5 and, on real Delhi, came in 24% WORSE than
# a naive city-mean (LOSO R2 0.52, RMSE 75 vs 60.7). The reason is visible in its own
# feature importances: temp_c, hour, wind — it was spending nearly all its capacity
# re-learning the CITYWIDE TEMPORAL signal (in Delhi's November episodes every
# station spikes together, so pollution is regionally dominated), and then getting
# the spatial part wrong on top of it.
#
# But the citywide signal is the one thing the station network measures WELL. Hand it
# to the model for free, and make it learn only what stations cannot tell you: the
# SPATIAL DEVIATION of a cell from the city as a whole.

# This cannot lose to the naive baseline by construction: predicting a zero residual
# IS the naive baseline. Every bit of skill above that is spatial skill, which is the
# only thing we ever claimed to add.

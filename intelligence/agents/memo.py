"""Enforcement Memo Agent — Node 5. The demo climax, and the business case.

Turns a ranked action into a dispatch-ready enforcement memo: the evidence chain
verbatim, the ward it is addressed to, and THE LEGAL PROVISION IT VIOLATES.

    "We detected a burning landfill"          <- a detection
    "Here is the notice, citing the rule,
     addressed to the ward, ready to serve"  <- a product

THE NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE (principle 1, and it matters most here)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A DETERMINISTIC RULE ENGINE PICKS THE STATUTE. The LLM only writes the connective
prose. You cannot let a language model choose a legal citation — it will hallucinate
a section number that sounds right, and that document goes in front of a violator,
and possibly a judge. The eligibility conditions below are plain `eq / in / gte /
lte` comparisons against the situation, exactly as specified in the architecture
doc, and the same situation always yields the same citation.

If the LLM is unavailable, `rule_based_prose()` produces the identical schema. The
memo never fails silent.

⚠️ THE CITATIONS ARE INDICATIVE, NOT LEGAL ADVICE
-------------------------------------------------
These are the well-known provisions a pollution control board actually acts under,
and every memo says so on its face. Nobody on this team is a lawyer. The memo is a
DRAFT for an officer to review and sign, and it states that in the document itself —
which is also, as it happens, the honest way to ship it.

Reads `actions.json` (the EPS queue) when it exists. If the prioritisation agent has
not landed yet, it builds zone-level actions straight from hotspots + attributions so
this agent is never blocked on another one.

Output: data/outputs/memos.json  (+ POST /memo/{action_id} serves one)

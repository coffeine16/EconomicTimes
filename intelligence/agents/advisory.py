"""Citizen Health Risk Advisory Agent — Node 6.

Ward-level health advisories: forecast AQI x population vulnerability -> a risk tier
and a plain-language advisory in the citizen's own language.

THE RULES THIS FOLLOWS (same discipline as every other agent here)

1. THE HEALTH CATEGORY IS DETERMINISTIC. The AQI band comes from the official CPCB
   NAQI breakpoints and the risk tier is plain arithmetic over (band, vulnerability).
   An LLM never decides how dangerous the air is. It may only phrase what the
   arithmetic already concluded.

2. THE FALLBACK MUST SPEAK THE LANGUAGES TOO. "Language coverage" that evaporates
   when GEMINI_API_KEY is missing is not coverage. So every language ships a
   rule-based template, and the LLM is a *nicety* that makes the prose warmer — not
   the thing that makes it exist.

3. THE ENGLISH IS NOT INVENTED. The health-impact wording is CPCB's own published
   NAQI advisory text per band. We are not qualified to write original medical advice
   and we do not; we route the official line to the right ward at the right time.

⚠️ REVIEW STATUS IS PER LANGUAGE, AND IT IS PART OF THE OUTPUT.
Shipping unreviewed health advice in a language nobody on the team reads is exactly
the confident-but-unverified claim this project keeps deleting. So each language
carries its own flag (see LANG_REVIEWED) and the disclaimer names the specific
languages that are still drafts:

    en  CPCB's own published NAQI wording. Not our words.
    hi  REVIEWED — a Hindi speaker on the team rejected the first draft as too formal
        and the register was rewritten to everyday speech.
    ta  REVIEWED — the team's NATIVE Tamil speaker confirmed the everyday register
        reads correctly. Approved unchanged.
    kn  DRAFT — nobody on this team reads Kannada. Ships flagged. See LANG_REVIEWED.

Note that machine translation would NOT fix this. It moves the unverified text from
one author to another; it does not make anyone able to check it. A human reading the
language is the only thing that flips the flag.

WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT SEE FOR VULNERABILITY
The brief asks for "hospitals, schools, outdoor workers, elderly populations".
  schools + hospitals  -> we have them (OSM, `lu_sensitive`)
  outdoor workers      -> no free national dataset; NOT modelled
  elderly              -> needs Census ward-level age data; NOT modelled
We report the two we can measure and say so, rather than inventing a proxy.

"""Source Attribution Agent — the innovation core.

For each hotspot: assemble a structured evidence profile from data already in
the panel, score each source category deterministically, then have the LLM
write the grounded explanation (rule-based prose if no LLM). The LLM never
picks the answer alone — category scores are arithmetic; the LLM explains.

Evidence per hotspot:
  candidates        named sources within 5 km: distance, bearing, wind alignment
  pollutant_signature  satellite ratios vs city percentiles (SO2->industrial,
                       AAI->burning, NO2 @ rush hours->traffic)
  fire_activity     FIRMS detections near the cell, trailing 6 h
  landuse_context   source-kind counts within 1.5 km
  meteorology       wind, boundary layer (is air trapped? where does it come from?)

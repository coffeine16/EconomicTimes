"""
intelligence/agents/voice.py

Turns each ward's text advisory into an MP3 in that ward's language, using
Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. See docs/voice-spec.md for the full brief.

Design rules (project-wide, from spec §6):
  1. Cache by text hash — never re-synthesize unchanged text.
  2. Batch, never per-request — this runs in the pipeline, not in a request handler.
  3. Never fail the pipeline — TTS errors are logged and skipped, text ships regardless.

Usage:
    python intelligence/agents/voice.py
or, wired into the pipeline:
    from intelligence.agents.voice import run as voice_run
    voice_run()

"""Agent orchestrator — the LangGraph StateGraph over the agent chain.

WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
  It orchestrates the AGENT chain only:

      detection -> attribution -> forecast -> prioritisation -> memo
                -> advisory -> voice -> ledger -> audit

  Ingestion, the panel build and fusion/LOSO are deliberately OUTSIDE the graph.
  They are heavy batch data-engineering (LOSO retrains 12 LightGBM models), not
  agents, and they must never be reachable from a request handler — the agents
  read their precomputed artifacts. That split is what makes POST /run/agent
  safe to expose: the worst case is ~a minute of deterministic agent compute
  over data already on disk.

WHY A GRAPH AT ALL (it is a straight line)
  Three reasons, in honesty order:
  1. PER-NODE ERROR ISOLATION. Each node is wrapped so one failing agent records
     an error and the chain CONTINUES — a broken forecast must not take down the
     memo. run_pipeline.py used to be six bare calls where the first exception
     killed everything after it.
  2. ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH for chain order. The pipeline runner and the API both
     execute THIS graph, so the order cannot drift between them (we have already
     been bitten once by a patch that silently missed one of the two copies).
  3. The brief names "Multi-Agent AI Systems" and our architecture doc specifies
     a LangGraph StateGraph. Using the real library makes that claim true on the
     deck rather than decorative.

FALLBACK (principle 2): if langgraph is not importable, the same nodes run
sequentially with identical error isolation and an identical result schema.
The orchestration never fails because a dependency is missing.

The result schema matches the frontend's PipelineRunResult exactly
(useAgentRun.ts / AgentProgressStrip.tsx — built by Suyash against this shape):

    {"run_id", "started_at", "completed_at",
     "agents": [{"name", "status": "done"|"error", "duration_ms", "error"?}]}

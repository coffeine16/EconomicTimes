# coverage over Bengaluru), and nothing burns when it is wet — real FIRMS returns
# 2 fires over Bengaluru and 9 over Delhi in 60 days, against 281 in our synthetic
# world. Fire persistence is ~0 in every cell, so the FIRMS channel — half the
# detector, and the half that locates unregistered burning sources — contributes
# nothing at all.

# Delhi's stubble-burning season is Oct-Nov: dry skies (high NO2 coverage) and a

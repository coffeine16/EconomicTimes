 * Opening viewport per city.
 *
 * This used to be a single hardcoded Delhi position. The map therefore always
 * opened over Delhi, and when the saved city was Chennai or Bengaluru the
 * viewport sat ~1,700 km from the data — hexagons rendered off-screen and the
 * map looked empty until you switched city, which forced a recentre. It only
 * showed up once localStorage held a non-Delhi city, which is why it appeared
 * to be intermittent.
 *
 * The recentre effect in MapContainer still fits to the loaded data; this makes
 * the FIRST frame land in the right place instead of relying on that.
